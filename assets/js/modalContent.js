<p>The <b>property taxpayer</b> for buildings in the Urban agglomeration of Montreal were <b>scraped</b> from the <a href="https://servicesenligne2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/sel/evalweb/index"><i></i>Consultation du rôle d'évaluation foncière</i></a> in September 2020, and filtered to exclude properties with one unit and one owner. Addresses were supplied by <a href="https://openaddresses.io/">OpenAddresses</a>. Properties were matched based on the name and address of the property taxpayer, to find the <b>number of buildings</b> sharing the same taxpayer.</p>
`

//<p>For owners affiliated with at least 5 properties, matches were researched and <b>affiliated</b> with particular corporations, managers, or landlords based on information in the <a href="https://www.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/CorporateLlcController">Illinois Secretary of State LLC Search</a> and other public records, including the <a href="https://cookrecorder.com/search-our-records/">Cook County Recorder of Deeds</a>.</p>
